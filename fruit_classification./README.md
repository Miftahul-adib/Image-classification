# 🍎🍌 Fruit Classification using VGG16 (Transfer Learning)

This project implements **Fruit Image Classification** using the **VGG16 pre-trained model** (on ImageNet) with transfer learning in TensorFlow/Keras.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Transfer learning using **VGG16**  
- Image preprocessing and augmentation  
- Fine-tuning the model for fruit classification  
- Training and validation with accuracy/loss plots  
- Evaluation on test data
