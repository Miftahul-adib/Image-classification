# Image-classification
## Transfer learning with VGG16 and fine-tuning for image classification, optionally using data augmentation.

## 1st project:

## Dogs vs. Cats Classification with VGG16

This project classifies images of dogs and cats using transfer learning with the VGG16 model in TensorFlow/Keras.

## 2nd project:

##  Fruit Classification using VGG16 (Transfer Learning)

This project implements **Fruit Image Classification** using the **VGG16 pre-trained model** (on ImageNet) and fine tuned on Fruits100
dataset

# Dataset-[Fruits-100 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/fruits-100) from Kaggle.
